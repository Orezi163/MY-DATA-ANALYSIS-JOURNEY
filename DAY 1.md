# My Thoughts Journal ✍️

This is where I write down my journey, one day at a time.  
Each file is like a diary entry with the date in the title.  

## Goals
- Be honest with myself
- Show my progress
- Learn discipline by writing daily
- Practice using GitHub like a pro

## Entries
- [Day 1 – I Know Nothing Yet](day-1.md)
