# Day 1 – I Know Nothing Yet

## Why I’ve Been Lazy
I’ve been letting procrastination and self-doubt stop me.  
Instead of starting small, I scroll, wait, and delay.  

## What I Want from Data Analysis
- Clarity and growth  
- Freedom to work remotely  
- A skill that helps people, especially in healthcare  

## How I’ll Stop Quitting
- Write and learn a little bit every day  
- Measure progress in time, not just results  
- Remember: every expert once started at zero  

✨ Today I don’t know much, but this is my first step.
